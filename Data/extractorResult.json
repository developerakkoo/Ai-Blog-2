    "text": " When it comes to high-end hypercars and super-fast supercars, a few companies should come to mind first: Bugatti, Ferrari, Koenigsegg, Rimac, and Pagani, among others. These manufacturers have cemented themselves as the top dogs in the supercar and hypercar space, extending to their wealthiest clientele the fastest, rarest, prettiest – and in this case – most expensive cars on the planet. But in order to find out which of these unattainable-to-most vehicles is the priciest, we've scoured the invoice sheets and uncovered 50 cars all worth $1 million or more. The group includes hybrid Ferrari convertibles, an American speed king, a few electric Hypercars, and two a one-of-a-kind Rolls-Royce cars built for royalty. We should note, though: The prices listed here are the price of the vehicles when new. So we’re not counting auction cars like the Ferrari 250 GTO, or overpriced secondhand sales. But don’t worry, there’s still hundreds of millions worth of cars here to whet your appetite.  Other Awesome Automotive Lists:                Price: $1.3 Million The De Tomaso P72 is basically the definition of beautiful. The shapely supercar debuted at the 2019 Goodwood Festival Of Speed with a supercharged Ford V8 boasting 700 horsepower. The P72 marked the return of the DeTomaso brand after nearly 30 years on hiatus, and if you want one, it will cost you at least $1.3 million.              Price: $1.4 Million At $1.4 million new, the Ferrari LaFerrari is actually one of the most affordable supercars on this list. It’s a bargain compared to the most expensive vehicle here. Debuting in 2013 with 950 hybrid horses (708 kilowatts) and a top speed of around 220 miles per hour (354 kilometers per hour), this is still Ferrari’s fastest and most powerful production model to date. The company built just 499 examples of the coupe between 2013 and 2016.              Price: $1.4 Million Inarguably one of the prettiest cars on this list, the Pagani Huayra cost a cool $1.4 million when new. Like the LaFerrari, Pagani built the Huayra in extremely limited numbers. The company hand-constructed just 100 units of the coupe between 2012 and 2018, with another 20 versions of the BC model (which makes our list further down) between 2017 and 2019. Powering each and every example was a Mercedes-AMG V12 capable of 720 horsepower (537 kilowatts).              Price: $1.7 Million The McLaren Elva is one of the latest additions to the British supercar maker’s storied legacy. Even without a proper windshield (though, no option) or roof to rely on, the Elva produces 804 horsepower and 590 pound-feet of torque from its twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8. Originally McLaren announced just 399 units, but later the company dropped that to an even more scarce 249 examples. Either way, most of you will never get your hands on one – the Elva costs $1.7 million.              Price: $1.7 Million You might not know the name Czinger yet, but this California-based boutique automaker is responsible for the $1.7 million 21C supercar. With 1,250 horsepower on tap thanks to a 2.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8, the 21C can rocket to 60 miles per hour in 1.9 seconds and a top speed of around 281 miles per hour.              Price: $1.7 Million Much like the roof-less McLaren Elva, the Ferrari Monza SP1 and SP2 are all about al fresco motoring. As the name implies, the SP1 is the single-seater option while the SP2 has just enough room for you to bring along a friend. Both cars come powered by the same naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 engine capable of 809 horsepower and 530 pound-feet. Unfortunately for US buyers, neither of these models are street legal in the States. But f you have the funds to afford the car’s $1.75 million price tag, getting onto a track probably won’t be an issue anyway.              Price: $1.7 Million The second and slightly more affordable supercar in the new Gordon Murray lineup is the T.33. With 607 horsepower courtesy of a naturally aspirated 3.9-liter V12, the T.33 revs to a ridiculous 10,500 RPM. With a price tag of around $1.7 million at current conversion rates, Gordon Murray automotive promises to sell this car globally, in both right- and left-hand-drive configurations. Too bad it's already sold out.              Price: $1.7 Million One of two Koenigsegg models on this list, the Gemera is actually the Swedish supercar maker’s first four-seater. But that doesn’t mean it’s some family car. With a twin-turbocharged 2.0-liter engine under the hood and three electric motors, the Gemera has 1,700 horsepower and will hit 60 in just 1.9 seconds. The company only plans to build 300 of them, each one costing at least $1.7 million.              Price: $1.7 Million Hailing from Denmark, the Zenvo TSR-S debuted in 2018 at the Geneva Motor Show as the most extreme option in the supercar startup’s repertoire. Boasting a twin-charged 5.8-liter V8 engine, the TSR-S produces 1,177 horsepower and will hit 62 miles per hour in just 2.8 seconds. Expect to pay at least $1.7 million to get your hands on this powerful and limited supercar.              Price: $1.8 Million The Hennessey Venom GT was a record-breaker, topping out at 265.7 miles per hour in a world record run. But the new F5 plans to beat its predecessor with an estimated top speed of 311 mph, and with that comes a higher price, too. The Venom F5 starts at $1.8 million, according to the company, which makes it just a bit pricier than its $1.2-million predecessor.              Price: $1.9 Million With just 12 total units produced, the Bentley Bacalar makes some of the \"limited\" cars on this list look plentiful by comparison. Although the car’s opulent design may be the first thing to grab your attention, the Bacalar is no slouch in terms of performance either. With Bentley’s signature turbocharged 6.0-liter W12 turbocharged engine, this car delivers 650 horsepower and 664 pound-feet. If you have a spare $1.9 million lying around and are considering buying one, you’re already too late – Bentley says that every example is now in customer hands.              Price: $1.9 Million To call the Hispano Suiza Carmen Boulogne beautiful would be... a stretch. But this interesting-looking supercar made its US debut at this year's Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance boasting a 1,114-horsepower electric powertrain and a 0-60 time of 2.6 seconds. The Boulogne version pictured here – the lighter and more powerful of the two – costs close to $1.9 million.              Price: $2.0 Million The electric onslaught is coming. Bentley says it will be a fully electric automaker by 2030. But before the luxury brand transitions to battery power fully, the Mulliner Batur helps send the iconic W12 engine off in style. With 710 horsepower from that twin-turbocharged engine, the Batur is the most powerful Bentley ever. And since it's limited to just 18 examples globally, the Batur costs a whopping $2.0 million.              Price: $2.0 Million The Deus Vayanne may not be a household name (yet), but the all-electric hypercar debuted earlier this year with 2,200 horsepower, a 0-60 time of just under 2.0 seconds, and an estimated top speed of 248 miles per hour. Deus plans to build 99 examples of the Vayanne, with the first few examples scheduled to go on sale in 2025.              Price: $2.0 Million* Although initially cloaked in controversy, SSC did manage to hit 282.9 miles per hour with its Tuatara hypercar, breaking a world record. But not only is the Tuatara one of the fastest vehicles on the planet, it’s also one of the priciest. The cost for all that speed is estimated to be around $2.0 million for the base Tuatara, limited to just 100 units worldwide.              Price: $2.1 Million With a new Emira sports car and an Eletre electric SUV, Lotus is on the brink of a comeback. The automaker plans to roll out a number of new products within the next few years, with part of that strategy including the range-topping Evija. This supercar comes in at a cool $2.1 million and produces nearly 2,000 horsepower via four electric motors. Lotus plans to build just 130 road-going examples of the Evija.              Price: $2.3 Million As with a few other cars on this list, the Aston Martin Vulcan was a track-only special. The British supercar made its world debut in 2015, powered by a naturally aspirated 7.0-liter V12 that produced 820 horsepower, and limited to just 24 examples worldwide. An even more track-focused AMR Pro model followed, but even the base Vulcan was a pricey commodity, costing about $2.4-million from the factory.              Price: $2.3 Million You may have heard of Delage before. In the early 1900s, this French automaker was competing on the track with Bugatti and Ferrari. Now Delage is back and with a beautiful new hypercar dubbed the D12. Powered by a 7.6-liter V12 engine, the new D12 produces upwards of 1,010 horsepower and costs a cool $2.3 million.              Price: $2.3 Million What would you pay for the fastest production McLaren ever? Well, at least $2.3 million. With 1,035 horsepower courtesy of a gasoline-electric hybrid V8 powertrain, the Speedtail tops out at 250 miles per hour and is able to reach 186 mph in just 12.8 seconds – 2.7 seconds faster than the P1. Unfortunately, if you didn't get your hands on one new in 2020, you'll have to shell out serious cash on the used market. McLaren only built 106 examples.              Price: $2.4 Million The Rimac Nevera takes the title of most expensive EV with its $2.4 million price tag – but only by a few hundred thousand dollars over the next priciest electric supercar. Packing 1,914 horsepower and 1,740 pound-feet of torque, the Nevera can hit 60 in under 2.0 seconds and will continue on to a top speed of 258 miles per hour. Those lucky enough to order one should see it in their driveway before the end of 2022.              Price: $2.5 Million First came the Zonda, then the Huayra, and now the Pagani Utopia. With 852 horsepower and an available seven-speed manual gearbox, the Utopia is the most powerful road-going Pagani ever produced and it’s limited to just 99 examples worldwide. The cost for one is a cool $2.5 million.              Price: $2.5 Million Aptly named after the company’s founder, Battista Farina, the Pininfarina Battista delivers the kind of performance (and price!) to make its namesake proud. Revealed at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show, the Battista is completely electric, putting out 1,827 horsepower. If a normal supercar’s 0 to 60 time sounds too leisurely for you, the company says that the Battista will take you there in under 2.0 seconds. Pininfarina plans on building 150 examples of the Battista, costing $2.5 million each.              Price: $2.6 Million Sure, you could buy a normal LaFerrari (which also makes the list further down), but why settle for a supercar so mundane when you can take home this track-only version instead? Granted, the Ferrari FXX K Evo came out in 2017, and it's well past the point of being sold out. But when it was new, this 1,036-horsepower Ferrari tore up the track with its naturally aspirated V12 and aggressive aerodynamics.              Price: $2.6 Million If the name Gordon Murray sounds familiar, it’s because he's the man behind the design of the iconic McLaren F1. These days, Mr. Murray has his own supercar venture, and the handsome T.50 is the crown jewel of the lineup. At $2.6 million, the T.50 packs a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter V12 that makes 654 horsepower. The car itself weighs a mere 2,174 pounds, and at 392 pounds, the T.50 has the lightest V12 on the road today.              Price: $2.6 Million The name Countach may be iconic, but is it worth $2.6 million? That's what Lamborghini hopes you will spend on its new Aventador-based model. Debuting in August of 2021, the Countach LPI 800-4 has a 6.5-liter V12 with a light hybrid assist that gives it a whopping 803 horsepower, allowing for a 60 time of 2.8 seconds and a top speed of more than 220 miles per hour.              Price: $2.7 Million Mercedes has promised a production version of the Project One hypercar for quite a while now. The first official announcement was in March of 2017 before the first concept debuted later that same year. But after nearly five years of teasing, it appears as if the Project One will finally hit public roads. And when it does, the hybrid hypercar will have over 1,200 horsepower (895 kilowatts) and a price tag of $2.7 million.              Price: $3.0 Million The folks at Aston Martin know a thing or two about exclusive vehicles, and the Victor might be the most exclusive project for the British brand to date. Based on the One-77 platform, the Victor uses parts from several donor Astons including the track project Vulcan and the upcoming Valkyrie. And talking about limited production – the Victor is one-of-one and rumored to cost nearly $3 million.              $3.0 Million The same Hennessey Venom F5 hypercar we all know and love, but with less roof. The F5 Roadster has the same twin-turbocharged 6.6-liter V8 as the coupe, producing the same 1,817 horsepower and 1,193 pound-feet of torque. Hennessey estimates a top speed of over 300 miles per hour, but if you want one, it will cost you at least $3.0 million.              Price: $3.0 Million The Koenigsegg Jesko, apart from being the fastest car the company has made to date, is also the most expensive. At $3.0 million out of the box, the handsome hypercar has 1,600-horsepower courtesy of the brand's ubiquitous twin-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8 engine. Opt for the Absolut model, and the Jesko, in theory, will be able to hit 300 miles per hour.              Price: $3.2 Million The upcoming Aston Martin hybrid hypercar hasn’t even hit the market yet, but already the $3.2 million Valkyrie has sold out. For what it’s worth, Aston Martin hasn’t officially released pricing. Estimates suggest the hypercar could go for anywhere between $2.6 and $3.9 million – but $3.2 million seems to be the magic number. Whatever the case, this machine is impressive. Its Cosworth-sourced 6.5-liter V12 produces 1,160 horsepower (865 kilowatts) and 664 pound-feet (900 Newton-meters) of torque, meaning its top speed should be well over 200 miles per hour (321 kilometers per hour). The company will build just 150 examples of the standard Valkyrie, with a limited 25-run AMR model arriving later.              Price: $3.4 Million Dubai-based W Motors shocked the world with its edgy Lykan Hypersport supercar in 2013. With titanium LED headlights housing 420 15-carat diamonds and a holographic display in the center console, it's no surprise it was the third most expensive car ever when new. It falls to number six on our list here, but it's still a wild hypercar with a powerful heart; the twin-turbocharged 3.7-liter six-cylinder engine underhood produces 780 horsepower (581 kilowatts) and 708 (960 Newton-meters) of torque.              $3.5 Million One seat, 829 horsepower, and a top speed of over 200 miles per hour. The new McLaren Solus is about as close as you can get to a Formula 1 car from the factory, powered by a naturally aspirated 5.2-liter V10 engine with a 0-62 mile-per-hour time of just 2.5 seconds. Estimates suggest a McLaren Solus will set you back about $3.5 million.              Price: $3.5 Million Following Pagani’s past playbook, a roadster version of the ferocious Huayra BC was inevitable. Last year, the company made it official by showing off the Huayra Roadster BC, a topless monster with 800 horsepower (597 kilowatts) and 774 lb-ft of torque (1049 Newton-meters). Somewhat surprisingly, Pagani gave the roadster 50 more horsepower than its coupe sibling, by cranking up its AMG-sourced twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter V12. In addition to the joy of hearing the glorious engine note without a roof in the way, owners should take comfort in knowing that their car is ultra-rare. Pagani is limiting production to just 40 units, each with a sticker price of $3.5 million.              Price: $3.6 Million Another showstopper from the Geneva Motor Show that never was, the Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport is a special edition Chiron with a focus on aerodynamics, weight reduction, and power distribution. It’s the same 8.0-liter quad-turbo W16 engine underneath the skin but it’s now mated to a recalibrated automatic gearbox. While the peak output remains unchanged at 1,500 horsepower (1,103 kilowatts), the rpm redline has been set 200 rpm higher, up to 6,900 rpm. The Pur Sport also features slightly revised bodywork, with a bigger rear wing and more aerodynamic front fascia. Beginning production in late 2020, the Bugatti starts at $3.6 million.              Price: $3.6 million In several ways, the Sian represents a bridge to Lamborghini’s future. Though it’s based on the Aventador SVJ, this wild-looking Lambo is the brand’s first production electrified offering. In addition to the SVJ-sourced 6.5-liter V12, the Sian uses a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Total system output is 819 horsepower (611 kilowatts), which also makes it the most powerful Lamborghini ever. As confirmed by the 63 stuck on either side of the Sian’s wing, Lamborghini will produce just 63 units. And each will cost far more than the Aventador SVJ, carrying a price of $3.6 million.              Price: $3.7 Million The Koenigsegg CC850 was a surprise to be sure, but a welcomed one. Borrowing the twin-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8 from the Jesko, it notches that output up to 1,385 horsepower and 1,022 pound-feet of torque, with a so-called “TWMPAFMPC” transmission that shifts (pun intended) between manual and automatic functions. Of course, all that performance technology will cost you; the CC850 starts at $3.7 million.              Price: $3.9 Million Earlier this year, Bugatti captured the collective attention of the automotive world by announcing that it broke the 300 miles per hour barrier with a modified version of the Chiron. The Super Sport 300 + is a road-going version of that car, meant to celebrate the occasion. Limited to just 30 units, the Super Sport 300+ is a beautiful version of the Chiron, with flowing, slippery bodywork and a sweet stripe motif. Despite having hit 304.8 mph on the track with a production vehicle, Bugatti does limit its Chiron 300+ to 273 mph in top speed mode.              Price: $4.5 Million Lamborghini built just 14 examples of the Aventador-based Veneno between 2014 and 2015. Each one cost around $4.5 million, depending on how it was spec'd, and was available in both convertible and coupe configurations. Underhood Lamborghini fitted a more-powerful iteration of the Aventador's 6.5-liter V12, now producing 740 horsepower (552 kilowatts) and 509 pound-feet (609 Newton-meters) of torque, which gave it the ability to sprint to 60 miles per hour (96 kilometers per hour) in a blistering 2.9 seconds. To date, it’s the most expensive new Lamborghini ever.              Price: $4.7 Million Produced in extremely limited numbers atop the body of a Chiron, it's no wonder Bugatti's one-of-40 Bolide track car is this pricey. At $4.7 million, the 1,824-horsepower hypercar has more power than the Chiron Super Sport 300+, and more extreme bodywork that allow it to lap tracks like the Nurburgring in record time (in theory). Bugatti says the Bolide would be able to conquer the ‘Ring in record time.              Price: $5.0 Million The Bugatti Mistral sends the iconic W16 engine off in style. With 1,577 horsepower and no roof, the Mistral takes the best bits of the Chiron and borrows elements from the Bolide and Divo to create a truly unique roadster. Of course, Bugatti plans to build just 99 examples of the Mistral at the cost of around $5.0 million in the US – and all of them are already accounted for.              Price: $5.4 Million Even though the new Utopia marks the next big step for Pagani, the Huayra Imola packs nearly as much power with a twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter V12 engine producing 827 horsepower and 811 pound-feet of torque. The Huayra Imola is estimated to cost around $5.4 million new, which would make it the second most expensive Pagani of all time.              Price: $5.8 Million Among Bugatti’s recently debuted vehicles, the Divo is a staff favorite. Though it shares much in common with its cheaper (!) sibling the Chiron, the Divo has a lot going for it to justify the extra money. By adding lighter wheels, a carbon fiber intercooler and removing some sound deadening, Bugatti made the Divo 77 pounds lighter than the Chiron. Though power is unchanged from the Chiron’s 1,500 ponies (1,119 kilowatts), The Divo features a different aerodynamic setup, which makes it 8 seconds quicker around the Nardo test track. Finally, the moment you’ve been waiting for: Bugatti is making 40 examples of the car, each costing $5.8 million.              Price: $6.4 Million SP Automotive (short for Spyros Panopoulos) is a new name in the world of hypercars, but the brand's 2,000-horsepower, $6.4-million, aptly named Chaos has already made an impact. With a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V10, the base SP Automotive Chaos is one of the most expensive cars on this list – beating out many Lambos and Bugattis – but there's an even pricier version of this car that costs an eye-watering $14.4 million. That version reportedly packs 3,000 hp.              Price: $7.4 Million The long list of pricey (new) Paganis ends with the Codualunga. Inspired by 1960s Italian coachbuilding, the stunning exterior and steampunk-esque interior – while equally stunning – are only part of what makes this Pagani so pricey. Under the hood is a twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter V12 producing 829 horsepower and 809 pound-feet of torque, paired to a seven-speed sequential transmission for a real race-car–like feel. The cost for this one-of-five Pagani is $7.4 million.              Price: $8.0 Million Like many others before it, the Mercedes-Benz Maybach Exelero is a one-off. Commissioned by Fulda, a German subsidiary of Goodyear, to test its new tires, the Exlero debuted in 2004. Mercedes built the Exelero on the bones of a Maybach, and gave it the same twin-turbo V12 engine producing 690 horsepower (510 kilowatts) and 752 pound-feet (1,020 Newton-meters) of torque. Top speed is listed at 218 miles per hour (350 kilometers per hour) and adjusted for inflation, the Exelero would cost more than $10 million in today's money.              Price: $9.0 Million Bugatti debuted the Centodieci at last year’s Pebble Beach car week, showing off yet another ultra-rare, super-expensive model to the world. Limited to just 10 – dieci – units, the car is a modern throwback to the Bugatti EB110. At the same time, it’s meant to celebrate Bugatti’s momentous 110-year anniversary. Its unique styling cues won’t make everyone fall in love, but at least you won’t have to worry about seeing another one on the road. Carrying a price just shy of $9 million, the Centodiece is one of the most exclusive cars ever made.              Price: $10.8 Million While it may not look that different from a normal Chiron, the Profilée is quite literally one-of-a-kind. Bugatti built it initially as a test for a limited run of Profilée models, but this Chiron ended up being the only example. Boasting the same 1,476-horsepower quad-turbocharged W16 engine ubiquitous throughout the Chiron range, the Profilée has unique bodywork and a custom spoiler that helps separate it from the rest of the range.              Price: $12.8 Million Rolls-Royce, expectedly, takes two of the top three spots on this list, with the stunning Sweptail one-off from 2017 coming in at number three. With a monumental price tag of $13.0 million, it was, at the time of its debut, the most expensive new car ever. It's been outpriced since then, but the 453-horsepower luxury car is still a jaw-dropper.              Price: $13.4 Million With a price tag of $13.4 million, the one-off Bugatti La Voiture Noire is officially the most expensive new Bugatti ever made. And understandably so. A modern interpretation of Jean Bugatti's personal Type 57 SC Atlantic, the La Voiture Noire uses the same quad-turbocharged 8.0-liter W16 engine as the Chiron, producing 1,479 horsepower. It has six – that's right, six exhaust tips, radical new wheels, an aggressive, bespoke fascia, and a gigantic light-up badge in the rear that spells out the name of the brand. Of course, this one-of-one Bugatti already has a home.              Price: $28.0 Million (est.) Rolls-Royce is back in the business of coachbuilding with the gorgeous new Boat Tail. A successor to the stunning Sweptail from 2017 – which itself cost a reported $12.8 million – the Boat Tail has a unique two-tone exterior, custom high-end finishes inside, and even a \"hosting suite\" complete with a champagne fridge and built-in sun umbrella. Although Rolls-Royce doesn’t officially announce pricing for one-off builds such as this, rumor has it that the Boat Tail cost a whopping $28.0 million new.

Pininfarina plans on building 150 examples of the Battista, costing $2.5 million each.</p>  <section data-id=\"6588668\" data-border=\"\" data-widget=\"image\" draggable=\"true\"> <span> <svg>  </svg> </span> <picture> <source sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 30px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 50px), 649px\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/8AAn7v/s5/ferrari-laferrari-fxx-k.webp 213w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/8AAn7v/s6/ferrari-laferrari-fxx-k.webp 445w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/8AAn7v/s4/ferrari-laferrari-fxx-k.webp 889w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/8AAn7v/s3/ferrari-laferrari-fxx-k.webp 1280w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/8AAn7v/s2/ferrari-laferrari-fxx-k.webp 1440w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/8AAn7v/s1/ferrari-laferrari-fxx-k.webp 1920w\" type=\"image/webp\"> <source sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 30px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 50px), 649px\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/8AAn7v/s5/ferrari-laferrari-fxx-k.jpg 213w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/8AAn7v/s6/ferrari-laferrari-fxx-k.jpg 445w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/8AAn7v/s4/ferrari-laferrari-fxx-k.jpg 889w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/8AAn7v/s3/ferrari-laferrari-fxx-k.jpg 1280w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/8AAn7v/s2/ferrari-laferrari-fxx-k.jpg 1440w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/8AAn7v/s1/ferrari-laferrari-fxx-k.jpg 1920w\" type=\"image/jpeg\"> <img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"9\" width=\"16\" alt=\"Ferrari LaFerrari FXX K\" src=\"https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png\"> </picture> </section> <p><strong>Price: $2.6 Million</strong></p> <p>Sure, you could buy a normal LaFerrari (which also makes the list further down), but why settle for a supercar so mundane when you can take home this track-only version instead?

Its Cosworth-sourced 6.5-liter V12 produces 1,160 horsepower (865 kilowatts) and 664 pound-feet (900 Newton-meters) of torque, meaning its top speed should be well over 200 miles per hour (321 kilometers per hour). The company will build just 150 examples of the standard Valkyrie, with a limited 25-run AMR model arriving later.</p>  <section data-id=\"3829448\" data-border=\"\" data-widget=\"image\" draggable=\"true\"> <span> <svg>  </svg> </span> <picture> <source sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 30px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 50px), 649px\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/qjmoq/s5/w-motors-lykan-hypersport.webp 213w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/qjmoq/s6/w-motors-lykan-hypersport.webp 445w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/qjmoq/s4/w-motors-lykan-hypersport.webp 889w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/qjmoq/s3/w-motors-lykan-hypersport.webp 1280w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/qjmoq/s2/w-motors-lykan-hypersport.webp 1440w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/qjmoq/s1/w-motors-lykan-hypersport.webp 1920w\" type=\"image/webp\"> <source sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 30px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 50px), 649px\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/qjmoq/s5/w-motors-lykan-hypersport.jpg 213w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/qjmoq/s6/w-motors-lykan-hypersport.jpg 445w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/qjmoq/s4/w-motors-lykan-hypersport.jpg 889w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/qjmoq/s3/w-motors-lykan-hypersport.jpg 1280w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/qjmoq/s2/w-motors-lykan-hypersport.jpg 1440w, https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/qjmoq/s1/w-motors-lykan-hypersport.jpg 1920w\" type=\"image/jpeg\"> <img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"9\" width=\"16\" alt=\"12.

Though it shares much in common with its cheaper (!) sibling the Chiron, the Divo has a lot going for it to justify the extra money. By adding lighter wheels, a carbon fiber intercooler and removing some sound deadening, Bugatti made the Divo 77 pounds lighter than the Chiron. Though power is unchanged from the Chiron’s 1,500 ponies (1,119 kilowatts), The Divo features a different aerodynamic setup, which makes it 8 seconds quicker around the Nardo test track.

A modern interpretation of Jean Bugatti's personal Type 57 SC Atlantic, the La Voiture Noire uses the same quad-turbocharged 8.0-liter W16 engine as the Chiron, producing 1,479 horsepower.

    "text": "Chevrolet Camaro ZL1James Lipman|Car and DriverThe Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 walks the thin line that separates where the everyday meets the racetrack. Using the everyday Camaro (reviewed separately) as a building block, the tornado that is the ZL1 makes the mighty 455-hp Camaro LT1 and SS trims feel like comparative wind gusts. Credit the ZL1's trim-exclusive 650-hp supercharged V-8, as well as its wide Goodyear F1 SuperCar tires that are as sticky as s'mores. An available 1LE performance package awakes an even mightier beast, with the package adding even wider and stickier tires, adjustable camber plates at each corner, and Multimatic's Dynamic Suspension Spool Valve dampers. Think of the Camaro ZL1 as a NASCAR Cup Series racer for the street.Review, Pricing, and SpecsChevrolet CorvetteChevroletWith supercar performance, an affordable price tag, and flashy styling, the 2023 Chevrolet Corvette honors the nameplate's decades-old status as an automotive icon—but with a mid-engine twist. The current C8 is the first generation to have its naturally aspirated V-8 engine mounted behind the passenger compartment, which boosts Chevy's halo sports car into the realm of exotic machinery. Its sharp handling and explosive acceleration are a match for sports cars costing tens of thousands more, but it's also comfortable and refined enough to drive cross-country. The C8 is offered as both a convertible and a coupe, and the hardtop model has a roof panel that can be lifted off to allow the sun to shine in. Its cabin is cozy but comfortable, and there's adequate trunk storage for groceries or luggage, making the Corvette an easy sports car to live with on a daily basis. We're charmed by this perennial 10Best award winner, and we think you will be too.Review, Pricing, and SpecsAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowChevrolet Corvette Z06Car and DriverThe 2023 Chevy Corvette Z06 elevates the iconic nameplate into territory occupied by exotics from Ferrari and Lamborghini. With the engine now located behind the driver, it looks unlike any Z06 seen before. Not only is it considerably wider than the regular Corvette Stingray, but it also boasts bigger air intakes and a unique rear wing. Thanks to a flat-plane crankshaft, the new Z06's naturally aspirated 5.5-liter V-8 doesn't sound like any Vette that's come before, and it blasted the car to 60 mph in just 2.6 seconds at our test track. While it inherits the best amenities and technology from the Stingray, its performance and handling have been heightened and sharpened. Chevy switched to a mid-engine layout to make the C8 Corvette a supercar that more folks can afford, and the 2023 Corvette Z06 promises to embarrass more than a few people driving insanely expensive supercars when they meet at a racetrack. We were so impressed by the z06 that we named it to our 2023 10Best cars list alongside the Stingray.Review, Pricing, and SpecsFord MustangFordFor more than 55 years, the Ford Mustang has continued to evolve into a more sophisticated steed. This iteration comes standard with a 310-hp turbocharged inline-four EcoBoost engine with a six-speed manual transmission. And while the pony car gets as wild as the 760-hp Shelby GT500, reviewed separately, the more conventional choice is the Mustang GT with the 450-hp V-8 engine. Both the four-cylinder and V-8 can be mated to a manual transmission or a 10-speed automatic. Mustangs are offered either as a hard-shell coupe or rag-top convertible, but every Mustang powers the rear wheels. Although a High Performance 330-hp EcoBoost is an available upgrade for the four-cylinder, the Mustang is best served with the growling V-8. While its closest muscular rival, the Chevy Camaro, has a more ergonomic interior, the Mustang's larger back seat and better outward visibility make it easier to live with.Review, Pricing, and SpecsAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowMazda MX-5 MiataMazdaTo call the 2023 Mazda MX-5 Miata an icon would be an understatement. The drop-top compact sports car reinvented the niche when it appeared for the first time back in 1989. Since then, it has only gotten better, honing its performance and handling to what it is today: one of the most entertaining things on four wheels. The Miata competes with the Subaru BRZ and Toyota GR 86 twins but unlike those coupes, it's offered with either of two open-top body styles—a cloth-top convertible or a retractable hard-top Targa called RF. All models are powered by a revvy 181-hp four-cylinder and come with a standard six-speed manual gearbox, a combination that recalls the sports cars of yesteryear. An automatic transmission is available but stick with the manual; it makes this featherweight two-seater an engrossing drive partner. It isn't the best choice for daily commuting or long road trips, and tall drivers will find the cabin a bit cramped, but the Miata is equipped with the essentials, and its chassis is expertly tuned for maximum fun.Review, Pricing, and SpecsMcLaren ArturaMcLarenMcLaren embraces a hybridized future of high performance with the sculptural 2023 Artura supercar. The newly introduced mid-engine two-seater rides on a new lightweight platform. It also pairs a twin-turbo V-6–the company's first—with a battery-electric powertrain to create a plug-in-hybrid model—another first. The duo generates a combined 671 horsepower and 531 pound-feet of torque. Performance estimates are highlighted by a zero-to-60-mph time of 2.6 seconds and a top speed of 205 mph. Its bodywork is pure McLaren, complete with prominent air vents and scissor-style doors. Along with a more premium and spacious interior than the 720S, the 2023 Artura offers several convenience and driver-assistance features.Review, Pricing, and SpecsAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowPorsche 718 BoxsterCar and DriverAlthough the 2023 718 Boxster is technically the brand's entry-level car, its brilliant handling, powerful turbocharged engines, and connected-to-your-psyche steering make it anything but a diluted version of the hallowed 911. The Boxster and its sibling, the 718 Cayman coupe, are superb representations of what a sports car should be, making them excellent additions to our 10Best cars list. A mid-engine configuration gives the Boxster a balanced, light-on-its-feet feel on the road, and you can enjoy the aggressive exhaust note and the sun's warming rays at the same time with the top pulled back. Okay, you caught us waxing poetic; the Boxster isn't a perfect car. Cargo space is limited, there are only two seats inside its cockpit, and the best powertrain—the sweet, sonorous flat-six—is limited to the expensive GTS trim. But let's be real here—it's a sports car, so who would expect it to be all things to all drivers? That's what makes the 718 so special: It's brilliant at all things a sports car needs to be.Review, Pricing, and SpecsPorsche 718 CaymanCar and DriverWhen it comes to sports cars, we're easily charmed, but certain cars still linger in our minds for being truly outstanding. The 2023 Porsche 718 Cayman is one such sports car that continues to captivate our collective attention—and one that we're happy to have on our 2023 10Best cars list. Its turbocharged engines are mounted amidships, giving the Cayman—and its convertible sibling, the 718 Boxster—a natural handling advantage over front-engined rivals such as the Jaguar F-Type and the Toyota Supra. On a twisty road, the Cayman is unflappable, and its crisp handling makes you never want to stop driving. Sure, there are too few places to stash your phone, keys, and beverages inside the two-seat cabin, and the base turbo four could sound a bit more refined. Otherwise, the Cayman is an impeccably engineered sports car that's easy to love. We should know. We've fallen head over heels for our long-term 718 Cayman GTS 4.0, which has impressed us in all the ways expected—and even some unexpected, including how few compromises it requires to drive daily.Review, Pricing, and SpecsAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowPorsche 911PorscheIf you close your eyes and picture a Porsche, it's likely that the 911 renders first in your imagination. This rear-engined fastback is a legend—and for good reason. Make that many reasons. For decades it has been a benchmark for performance and handling and feel, inspiring rivals such as the Aston Martin Vantage, the Audi R8, and the Maserati MC20, to name a few. The \"standard\" 911 sticks to its roots with a set of twin-turbo flat-six engines that have been tuned for up to 473 horsepower. Higher-performance Turbo and GT3 models are available—this is Porsche, of course—but we review those cars separately. Most 911 models have rear-wheel drive but all-wheel drive is available. Coupe, cabriolet convertible, and Targa body styles are offered, and they have a cabin that is comfortable for two adults whether it's been decked out in luxuries or left bone stock. The 911's superiority stems not only from its lofty performance capabilities but also from the fact that it's comfortable enough to live with on a daily basis.Review, Pricing, and SpecsPorsche 911 GT3 / GT3 RSCar and DriverSimply put, the 2023 Porsche 911 GT3 and the all-out track-attack GT3 RS are utterly transcendent, blending everything we love about the standard 911 with otherworldly performance, uncompromised driving enjoyment, and hot-lap capability. A naturally aspirated 4.0-liter flat-six engine makes demonic sounds as it howls up to its 9000 rpm redline, producing 502 horsepower along the way in the GT3 and GT3 Touring. That same engine is twisted to 518 horsepower in the new GT3 RS, but it's that model's wild race-car aerodynamic elements—ideas cribbed from GT and Formula 1 race cars—that comprise its major engineering advancements. A six-speed manual is standard in GT3 models but we've proven the optional seven-speed PDK automatic is quicker, as it shifts quicker than a human and seems to be linked to the driver's cerebral cortex. The GT3 RS comes only with the PDK gearbox. While the GT3 and GT3 Touring models are designed to thrill on the world's most challenging race courses, they're nearly as supple-riding and easy to live with as the regular 911 when driven on city streets. It's this dual-purpose nature that makes the GT3 one of our favorite sports cars and why it easily earns a place on the highest pedestal of automotive icons. As for the GT3 RS, it's as serious about lap times as a 911 can get and still be licensed. We can't wait to drive it to see if it's too radical a car for anything but track duty.Review, Pricing, and SpecsAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowPorsche 911 Turbo / Turbo SCar and DriverThe Porsche 911 Turbo's delivery of speed is nothing short of freaky fast. Its all-wheel-drive launches are courtesy a standard 573-hp 3.7-liter flat-six or a 640-hp version for Turbo S models. It's among the quickest cars we've ever tested, getting to 30 mph in 0.8 seconds, to 60 mph in 2.1 seconds, and through a quarter-mile in just 9.9 seconds at 138 mph. Its rocket-like acceleration is undergirded by its ability to swallow corners in whole gulps thanks to its near-magical handling, amazing steering feel, and huge amount of grip. Although the 911 Turbo doesn't offer a manual transmission, the eight-speed dual-clutch automatic is quicker and smarter than us anyway. More time with both hands at the wheel is a good idea with power like this. While we love the rear-drive 473-hp 911 with a manual transmission, that doesn't mean we'd ever say no to the quicker and more firmly-sprung 911 Turbo and Turbo S.Review, Pricing, and SpecsSubaru BRZSubaruThe BRZ sports car is one of today's most exciting, affordable automobiles. Like its Toyota GR86 mechanical twin, it emphasizes driving fun. It's small, light, and nimble. That and ingredients like vivid steering feedback, a standard six-speed manual transmission, and a low seating position cook up entertainment the way only a well-honed compact rear-drive coupe can. It's these traits that earned the BRZ a spot on our 10Best cars list. The BRZ is motivated by Subaru's 228-hp 2.4-liter flat-four engine, which has plenty of power to move this small 2+2 briskly. Inside, the BRZ makes an excellent case for the manual transmission with a confident-feeling, low-effort shifter. The BRZ's responsive handling and impressive cornering grip practically beg you to take it to an autocross weekend. But the BRZ is also surprisingly practical, with plenty of useful interior storage cubbies and a rear jump seat—much like the one in the Porsche 911—capable of hauling a small fry or bags of groceries. In fact, if you fold down the rear seat, there should even be enough room to fit a second set of sticky tires, should that autocross weekend beckon.Review, Pricing, and SpecsAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowToyota GR86ToyotaIf we gave out an award for Most Improved Sports Car, the Toyota GR86 would very possibly be the big winner. This eminently entertaining rear-wheel-drive coupe's second generation arrived in 2022 and addressed our big issue with the original model: a weak engine. The second time around, power comes from a 228-hp flat-four with plenty of mid-range power, and although a six-speed manual comes standard (and is the only way to go), a six-speed automatic is available. You won't hear us telling you to opt for it. The GR86 is small and affordable, like, say, a Mazda MX-5 Miata, only with a tiny Porsche 911–type rear seat that enables you to take small fry along. Its hatchback body also affords reasonable cargo space, which the Miata doesn't offer, either. The GR86's mechanical twin, the Subaru BRZ, offers a virtually identical experience, so choosing between them ultimately comes down to which badge you prefer. As a 2+2 coupe built mainly for playtime, the GR86 does suffer from road noise, particularly on the highway, and the music produced by the boxer engine isn't exactly worth buying tickets to hear live. Still, plenty of cornering grip, great balance, sharp steering, and a rev-happy engine make the GR86 fun to drive, no matter where you're going. It's everything an entry-level sports car should be. And while we don't give a most improved trophy, we did give the GR 86 something even better: A 10Best award.Review, Pricing, and SpecsToyota GR SupraToyotaToyota's halo sports car, the 2023 GR Supra, delivers enough excitement, style, and drama to make up for the brand's more sedate sedans, hatchbacks, and SUVs. Developed and built alongside the BMW Z4 convertible, the GR Supra offers similar build quality and simpler—but still handsome—interior materials inside. The entry-level 255-hp turbocharged four-cylinder provides ample power, but we can't help but adore the ferocious, optional 382-hp turbocharged 3.0-liter BMW inline-six that makes this two-seater fly. Rear-wheel drive is the only setup, and the GR Supra's sure-footed chassis and sharp steering enable it to come alive on twisty roads and race courses. Sure, it may borrow a little too heavily from the BMW parts bin for some Toyota fanboys, and its sweptback exterior design creates some awfully large blind spots, but even so, the GR Supra remains one of our favorite sports cars. It's a driver's car and an enthusiast's delight, making it a no-brainer for our annual 10Best cars list.Review, Pricing, and SpecsAssociate EditorYes, he's still working on the 1986 Nissan 300ZX Turbo project car he started in high school, and no, it’s not for sale yet. Austin Irwin was born and raised in Michigan, and, despite getting shelled by hockey pucks during a not-so-successful goaltending career through high school and college, still has all of his teeth. He loves cars from the 1980s and Bleu, his Great Pyrenees, and is an active member of the Buffalo Wild Wings community. When Austin isn’t working on his own cars, he’s likely on the side of the highway helping someone else fix theirs.",

Cargo space is limited, there are only two seats inside its cockpit, and the best powertrain—the sweet, sonorous flat-six—is limited to the expensive GTS trim.

Most 911 models have rear-wheel drive but all-wheel drive is available. Coupe, cabriolet convertible, and Targa body styles are offered, and they have a cabin that is comfortable for two adults whether it's been decked out in luxuries or left bone stock. The 911's superiority stems not only from its lofty performance capabilities but also from the fact that it's comfortable enough to live with on a daily basis.</p><p><a data-vars-ga-ux-element=\"Hyperlink\" data-vars-ga-call-to-action=\"Review, Pricing, and Specs\" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/porsche/911\" href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/porsche/911\">Review, Pricing, and Specs</a></p></div></div><div><h2>Porsche 911 GT3 / GT3 RS</h2><div><p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"5760\" width=\"8640\" title=\"Porsche 911 GT3 RS Tribute to Carrera RS Edition\" src=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/911-gt3-rs-side-1676907438.jpeg?crop=0.588xw:0.441xh;0.231xw,0.309xh&amp;resize=980:*\" alt=\"porsche 911 gt3 rs tribute to carrera rs edition\" srcset=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/911-gt3-rs-side-1676907438.jpeg?crop=0.588xw:0.441xh;0.231xw,0.309xh&amp;resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/911-gt3-rs-side-1676907438.jpeg?crop=0.588xw:0.441xh;0.231xw,0.309xh&amp;resize=980:* 980w\"></p><figcaption><span>Car and Driver</span></figcaption></div><div><p>Simply put, the 2023 Porsche 911 GT3 and the all-out track-attack <a data-vars-ga-call-to-action=\"GT3 RS\" data-vars-ga-ux-element=\"Hyperlink\" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a40778771/2023-porsche-911-gt3-rs-revealed/\" href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a40778771/2023-porsche-911-gt3-rs-revealed/\">GT3 RS</a> are utterly transcendent, blending everything we love about the <a data-vars-ga-call-to-action=\"standard 911\" data-vars-ga-ux-element=\"Hyperlink\" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/porsche/911\" href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/porsche/911\">standard 911</a> with otherworldly performance, uncompromised driving enjoyment, and hot-lap capability. A naturally aspirated 4.0-liter flat-six engine makes demonic sounds as it howls up to its 9000 rpm redline, producing 502 horsepower along the way in the GT3 and GT3 Touring. That same engine is twisted to 518 horsepower in the new GT3 RS, but it's that model's wild race-car aerodynamic elements—ideas cribbed from GT and Formula 1 race cars—that comprise its major engineering advancements. A six-speed manual is standard in GT3 models but we've proven the optional seven-speed PDK automatic is quicker, as it shifts quicker than a human and seems to be linked to the driver's cerebral cortex. The GT3 RS comes only with the PDK gearbox. While the GT3 and GT3 Touring models are designed to thrill on the world's most challenging race courses, they're nearly as supple-riding and easy to live with as the regular 911 when driven on city streets. It's this dual-purpose nature that makes the GT3 one of our favorite sports cars and why it easily earns a place on the highest pedestal of automotive icons. As for the GT3 RS, it's as serious about lap times as a 911 can get and still be licensed. We can't wait to drive it to see if it's too radical a car for anything but track duty.</p><p><a data-vars-ga-ux-element=\"Hyperlink\" data-vars-ga-call-to-action=\"Review, Pricing, and Specs\" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/porsche/911-gt3-gt3-rs\" href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/porsche/911-gt3-gt3-rs\">Review, Pricing, and Specs</a></p></div></div></section><div><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p></div><section><div><h2>Porsche 911 Turbo / Turbo S</h2><div><p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"4882\" width=\"7319\" title=\"2021 Porsche 911 Turbo S\" src=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2021-porsche-911-turbo-s-pdk-130-edit-1608061336.jpg?crop=0.551xw:0.413xh;0.408xw,0.508xh&amp;resize=980:*\" alt=\"2021 porsche 911 turbo s\" srcset=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2021-porsche-911-turbo-s-pdk-130-edit-1608061336.jpg?crop=0.551xw:0.413xh;0.408xw,0.508xh&amp;resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2021-porsche-911-turbo-s-pdk-130-edit-1608061336.jpg?crop=0.551xw:0.413xh;0.408xw,0.508xh&amp;resize=980:* 980w\"></p><figcaption><span>Car and Driver</span></figcaption></div><div><p>The Porsche 911 Turbo's delivery of speed is nothing short of freaky fast.

It's small, light, and nimble.

Inside, the BRZ makes an excellent case for the manual transmission with a confident-feeling, low-effort shifter. The BRZ's responsive handling and impressive cornering grip practically beg you to take it to an autocross weekend. But the BRZ is also surprisingly practical, with plenty of useful interior storage cubbies and a rear jump seat—much like the one in the Porsche 911—capable of hauling a small fry or bags of groceries. In fact, if you fold down the rear seat, there should even be enough room to fit a second set of sticky tires, should that autocross weekend beckon.</p><p><a data-vars-ga-ux-element=\"Hyperlink\" data-vars-ga-call-to-action=\"Review, Pricing, and Specs\" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/subaru/brz\" href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/subaru/brz\">Review, Pricing, and Specs</a></p></div></div></section><div><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p></div><section><div><h2>Toyota GR86</h2><div><p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"4138\" width=\"6751\" title=\"2023 Toyota GR 86 Premium\" src=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2022-toyota-gr86-93-1629157639.jpg?crop=0.636xw:0.519xh;0.172xw,0.283xh&amp;resize=980:*\" alt=\"2023 toyota gr 86 premium\" srcset=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2022-toyota-gr86-93-1629157639.jpg?crop=0.636xw:0.519xh;0.172xw,0.283xh&amp;resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2022-toyota-gr86-93-1629157639.jpg?crop=0.636xw:0.519xh;0.172xw,0.283xh&amp;resize=980:* 980w\"></p><figcaption><span>Toyota</span></figcaption></div><div><p>If we gave out an award for Most Improved Sports Car, the Toyota GR86 would very possibly be the big winner. This eminently entertaining rear-wheel-drive coupe's second generation arrived in 2022 and addressed our big issue with the original model: a weak engine. The second time around, power comes from a 228-hp flat-four with plenty of mid-range power, and although a six-speed manual comes standard (and is the only way to go), a six-speed automatic is available. You won't hear us telling you to opt for it. The GR86 is small and affordable, like, say, a <a data-vars-ga-call-to-action=\"Mazda MX-5 Miata\" data-vars-ga-ux-element=\"Hyperlink\" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/mazda/mx-5-miata\" href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/mazda/mx-5-miata\">Mazda MX-5 Miata</a>, only with a tiny Porsche 911–type rear seat that enables you to take small fry along. Its hatchback body also affords reasonable cargo space, which the Miata doesn't offer, either. The GR86's mechanical twin, the <a data-vars-ga-call-to-action=\"Subaru BRZ\" data-vars-ga-ux-element=\"Hyperlink\" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/subaru/brz\" href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/subaru/brz\">Subaru BRZ</a>, offers a virtually identical experience, so choosing between them ultimately comes down to which badge you prefer. As a 2+2 coupe built mainly for playtime, the GR86 does suffer from road noise, particularly on the highway, and the music produced by the boxer engine isn't exactly worth buying tickets to hear live. Still, plenty of cornering grip, great balance, sharp steering, and a rev-happy engine make the GR86 fun to drive, no matter where you're going. It's everything an entry-level sports car should be.

    "text": "London’s air feels a little smoggier today. Which means the supercars have begun to cruise through Knightsbridge once again. They roll past Harrods, growl down Sloane Street and lounge on double-yellow lines, engines on. They rarely speed or streak along these thoroughfares – not unless asked, at least. The purpose is to peacock. Because if no one sees a supercar, was it ever really there in the first place? First popularised around 2010, supercar spotting involves hanging around on big-money streets, waiting to take pictures of big-money cars. What is a spotter looking for? Each has a different stipulation. Most are seeking a road-safe racing car that goes from 0 to 60 mph in less than five seconds and costs more than £100,000. Valued at around £16mn, the McLaren F1 is considered one of the best supercars of all time thanks to its V12 engine and relative scarcity (only 106 were made). The Nissan GT-R, which can hit 200mph, is less “canon” than some others as it only costs about £90,000.A Ferrari 488 spotted in Knightsbridge © Dougie WallaceOut on the streets of London with the supercar drivers © Dougie WallaceYou can car spot anywhere, but Knightsbridge and Mayfair are the meccas. From spring until September, hundreds of cars – Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bugattis – are flown to London from Arab states as a way to escape the desert heat. (UK-based Autoshippers offers an air freight service from £5,408 per car.) A dedicated spotter might catch 50 supercars a day during this period; in winter, the numbers are more like 15. Hotspots include the traffic lights opposite Knightsbridge station, Lowndes Square and the road verge that separates Park Lane. Just look for the man (for it is usually a man) holding a camera. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t£5,408\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCost of air-shipping a car to the UK from Dubai via Autoshippers\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tThe spotting community, I’ve learned, is a closed one. I have been trawling these streets for the past six months, risking traffic and making light of dual carriageways, and I haven’t made any friends on the circuit. Those who have spoken to me have done so distractedly: it’s not uncommon for someone to leave, mid-conversation, to chase after a pink Lamborghini. They seldom come back. On one occasion I waited outside Harrods for 20 minutes so that George, a 21-year-old spotter, could use the bathroom, only to discover he’d given me the slip and headed out of another exit. A Lamborghini driver poses for a selfie with a spotter © Dougie WallaceA Ferrari driver snapped in Knightsbridge © Dougie WallaceSpotting might sound simple on paper, but finding “good content” requires a few tricks. And with supercar spotting, it’s all about the content. If you spot a supercar at the junction where Sloane Street meets Pont Street, run to the set of traffic lights by Cadogan Place and wait there; you’ll get the first shot when it eventually drives down. I learn this from William, a fiftysomething engineer who hangs back from a rowdier group near the Millennium Hotel. Another tip: type “#liveupload” into Instagram’s search bar and find out where people are posting from. Serious spotters consider this method passé, but it’s a good place to start. Tim Burton (not the film director) – aka Shmee150 – started uploading photos of cars to Facebook in 2008, and quickly accumulated a following. Today he has more than 2.4mn YouTube subscribers, who tune in to watch him test drive new models, meet fellow fanatics and, on one occasion, take part in a Croatian police convoy. But the best thing about Shmee is his own personal car collection, a 20-strong “Shmuseum” worth more than $8mn, most of it funded through advertising revenue, sponsorship deals and consultancy work for car brands. “The idea of a Ferrari or a Lamborghini is something inspirational to aim for in life – a target,” says Shmee, whose latest acquisition is a mustard-yellow Lotus Emira First Edition. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t   \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tA Ferrari 812 spotted on Park Lane © Dougie Wallace\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tShmee took supercar spotting, a relatively unknown hobby, and turned it into a profitable enterprise. Everyone I meet knows him; everyone aspires to a similar future. Unlike train spotters who simply enjoy the meditative activity of watching railway lines, most supercar spotters are in it for the money. For online marketer Andrew, 45, who has been spotting for almost four years, the goal is to become “rich and famous”. Each weekend he comes to Knightsbridge to film content for his fledgling channel, “even when [his] fingers are too cold to press the record button”. Once a channel hits 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watched content within 12 months, the owner can apply for the YouTube Partner Programme. Those accepted make around $4.20 per 1,000 views; Shmee’s channel has more than 1bn. But most of all, Andrew just really likes cars. He watches a Lamborghini Huracán STO pass by with the wistful eyes of a lover. It’s hard to surmise the relationship between spotters and supercars. But a huge part of it is to do with freedom: cars have long been symbols of personal mobility. Add that to a six- or seven-figure price tag and Batmobile-style scissor doors and the results are irresistible. “Cars are a very emotional thing,” says Shmee extravagantly. “The sound, the feeling – the idea of what they can achieve, what they’re capable of – captivates the imagination.” A Ferrari F8 rolls by the Rolex store in Knightsbridge © Dougie Wallace\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\tNot everyone will agree – least of all the long-term residents of Park Lane. There is a long, documented struggle between supercar owners and west-Londoners, many of whom have set up campaign groups against noisy revvers and boy racers. “People are not sleeping until three or four in the morning,” Karen, a Knightsbridge local, told AFP News Agency in the early stages of the spotting craze. “There’s a lot of testosterone going up and down Sloane Street,” added her daughter, Alexandra, who wore periwinkle eyeshadow and a pearl necklace. “This is probably one of the few times in my life where I’m glad to be deaf.”\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t$4.20\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe approximate payout to YouTube Partner Programme members per 1,000 video views\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tIf not testosterone, then there’s certainly braggadocio. Often I try counting the number of supercars with parking tickets: I quickly lose count. One culprit, an orange Lamborghini Aventador, has the word “WE04 PON” for a number plate. Another has a sticker inviting fans to follow him on Instagram. Outside Harrods, I question Abdulaziz, who drives a crimson Ferrari, on what it is about the supercar that sets his pulse racing. “Why do you get up in the morning and go to work?” he responds. By Abdulaziz’s expression, it’s apparent he only does so for the love of his vehicle.Dedicated spotters have better relationships with owners, who have been known to offer rides and stage personal photo shoots. Shmee, who has been on both sides of this arrangement, advises “being polite, friendly” and, above all, respecting an owner’s privacy. “There’s a temptation to go exploring where you shouldn’t.” Cars are kept in a handful of private garages scattered across the city, most famously Windrush’s secret “bat cave” in west London. And good luck getting any intel on that. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t   \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSnapping a Ferrari FF © Dougie Wallace\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tPhotographer Josh Scoot, 21, has become such a hit with supercar owners that he’s toured the garages of not only Shmee, but American car show host Jay Leno and entrepreneur Richard Rawlings of Gas Monkey Garage. Scoot is what you might call a collector: his early days were spent travelling London with a pen and paper, keeping a note of supercars and their various editions. His first major spot was a Zonda Cinque, one of just 10 models made including the Cinque Roadsters. Today, he’s seen four. “Fingers crossed I can see all 10,” he says, an unlikely feat given that most are “kept underground, collecting dust, as they’re so rare.” \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\tWhen Scoot started spotting as a teenager, he found the hobby difficult to explain. “I didn’t have any confidence to tell even my closest mates,” says Scoot, who drives a Ford Fiesta; his “poster car” is a Ferrari 458. The experience led him to launch a series exploring bullying, discrimination and mental health on car enthusiast platform Petrolheadonism. Despite its closed ranks, those that do break into the super-spotter clique find the camaraderie to be the nicest thing about supercar spotting. “You see the same people every week,” says Tom, 16, of the hundreds of WhatsApp groups born out of spotting. Shmee also brings spotters together with regular car events; unsurprisingly, he calls them “Shmeetings”. A Porsche Cayman GT4 in Knightsbridge © Dougie WallaceA Ferrari 488 Spider driver © Dougie WallaceAs the community has grown, so have the supercars. With UK ownership expanding by around 20 per cent in recent years, brands have stepped up their technology in pursuit of better track times. “Factory-manufactured Ferraris no longer turn heads,” says Botho Stein, general manager of The May Fair Hotel, who has seen traction in “bespoke and custom-made cars such as Aston Martin One-77, Porsche 918 Spyder and Bugatti Chiron” outside his hotel. At Lamborghini, where global sales are up 10 per cent, the recent Sián FKP 37 (£2.6mn), has a carbon-fibre body, V12 engine and weighs just 1,645kg. All units sold out before their unveiling. Wilder still are limited-edition models by Ferrari, McLaren and Aston Martin made without roofs or windscreens.What do these changes mean for the supercar owner? The experience of driving these cars, one can assume, should be luxurious. “This is probably the thing that makes no sense,” giggles Shmee, “but the feeling of a supercar is generally one of being less comfortable. It’s noisier, vibrating; the seats aren’t so lovely and plush.” And yet. To drive one is to achieve a state that transcends all rhyme, reason and sensible spending. “You either get it or you don’t.”An unusual classic spotted in Knightsbridge  © Dougie WallaceA spotter admires a Lamborghini Huracán STO © Dougie WallaceWhile I still don’t quite “get it”, I certainly feel closer. To catch a supercar is to touch a world of limitless potential, where success stories abound and raw ambition is rewarded. Behind every supercar is someone who “made it”; every rev is a roar of triumph.\n\t\t\t\n\t\tI return to Knightsbridge for a final time in February, when the supercar’s roar is more of an occasional bark. The past few months have been quieter than usual – “they’ve gone to Monaco”, says Andrew mournfully. And it’s true that the super-web is spreading. HR Owen’s £30mn Hatfield headquarters has created a new content-heavy hotspot. But the “rolling motor show of central London”, as Shmee calls it, will forever be the spotter’s heartland. Where else is a McLaren Senna as commonplace as a bright-red postbox? ",

On one occasion I waited outside Harrods for 20 minutes so that George, a 21-year-old spotter, could use the bathroom, only to discover he’d given me the slip and&nbsp;headed out of another exit.&nbsp;</p><div data-layout-width=\"full-grid\"><figure><picture><source data-original-image-height=\"1600\" data-original-image-width=\"1600\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/8794bbd6-0341-44a3-b061-b9c30300ed3c\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F8794bbd6-0341-44a3-b061-b9c30300ed3c.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=490\" media=\"screen and (max-width: 490px)\"><source data-original-image-height=\"1600\" data-original-image-width=\"2400\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/46fad87b-2773-49bc-b0f3-feec26513a3a\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F46fad87b-2773-49bc-b0f3-feec26513a3a.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=1260\" media=\"screen and (min-width: 980px)\"><img srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F3ba5ce23-fb2b-4c04-9ab2-99c5e3fd4286.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=700 1x, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F3ba5ce23-fb2b-4c04-9ab2-99c5e3fd4286.jpg?dpr=2&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=medium&amp;source=next&amp;width=700 2x\" alt=\"A Lamborghini driver poses for a selfie with a spotter\" data-original-image-height=\"1600\" data-original-image-width=\"2400\" data-image-type=\"image\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/3ba5ce23-fb2b-4c04-9ab2-99c5e3fd4286\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F3ba5ce23-fb2b-4c04-9ab2-99c5e3fd4286.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=700\"></picture><figcaption data-has-caption=\"true\">A Lamborghini driver poses for a selfie with a spotter © Dougie Wallace</figcaption></figure></div><div data-layout-width=\"full-grid\"><figure><picture><source data-original-image-height=\"1600\" data-original-image-width=\"1600\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/6beb1b6b-2833-4011-accd-8e6d217e2733\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F6beb1b6b-2833-4011-accd-8e6d217e2733.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=490\" media=\"screen and (max-width: 490px)\"><source data-original-image-height=\"1600\" data-original-image-width=\"2400\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/ab6ed2a2-0f30-4ff4-b2fc-fb4f3eda1701\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fab6ed2a2-0f30-4ff4-b2fc-fb4f3eda1701.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=1260\" media=\"screen and (min-width: 980px)\"><img srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F7533447c-c937-42d8-9d20-8a0a1b2607e3.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=700 1x, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F7533447c-c937-42d8-9d20-8a0a1b2607e3.jpg?dpr=2&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=medium&amp;source=next&amp;width=700 2x\" alt=\"A Ferrari driver snapped in Knightsbridge\" data-original-image-height=\"1600\" data-original-image-width=\"2400\" data-image-type=\"image\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/7533447c-c937-42d8-9d20-8a0a1b2607e3\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F7533447c-c937-42d8-9d20-8a0a1b2607e3.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=700\"></picture><figcaption data-has-caption=\"true\">A Ferrari driver snapped in Knightsbridge © Dougie Wallace</figcaption></figure></div><p>Spotting might sound simple on paper, but finding “good content” requires a few tricks. And with supercar spotting, it’s all about the content. If you spot a supercar at the junction where Sloane Street meets Pont Street, run to the set of traffic lights by Cadogan Place and wait&nbsp;there; you’ll get the first shot when it eventually drives down. I learn this from William, a fiftysomething engineer who hangs back from a rowdier group near the Millennium Hotel. Another tip: type “#liveupload” into Instagram’s search bar and find out where people are posting from. Serious spotters consider this method passé, but it’s a good place to start.&nbsp;</p><p>Tim Burton (not the film director) – aka <a data-trackable=\"link\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIRgR4iANHI2taJdz8hjwLw\">Shmee150</a> – started uploading photos of cars to Facebook in 2008, and quickly accumulated a following. Today he has more than 2.4mn YouTube subscribers, who tune in to watch him test drive new models, meet fellow fanatics and, on one occasion, take part in a Croatian police convoy. But the best thing about Shmee is his own personal car collection, a 20-strong “Shmuseum” worth more than $8mn, most of it funded through advertising revenue, sponsorship deals and consultancy work for car brands. “The idea of a Ferrari or a Lamborghini is&nbsp;something inspirational to aim for in life – a target,” says Shmee, whose latest acquisition is a mustard-yellow&nbsp;<a data-trackable=\"link\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.lotuscars.com/en-GB/emira?gclid=CjwKCAjw__ihBhADEiwAXEazJjpcEsu2spQ8_Pi6zO8KIjZnZCP7709Dm-9FRoJAeUxY9ekRV--fMxoCqNsQAvD_BwE\">Lotus Emira</a> First Edition.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t<picture><source media=\"(min-width: 1220px)\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fe1ff1844-6780-4531-a627-46a0a9a90ad1.png?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;source=next&amp;width=700 1x\"> <source media=\"(min-width: 980px) and (max-width: 1219px)\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fe1ff1844-6780-4531-a627-46a0a9a90ad1.png?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;source=next&amp;width=540 1x\"> <source media=\"(min-width:491px) and (max-width: 979px)\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fe1ff1844-6780-4531-a627-46a0a9a90ad1.png?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;source=next&amp;width=700 1x\"> <source media=\"(max-width: 490px)\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fe1ff1844-6780-4531-a627-46a0a9a90ad1.png?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;source=next&amp;width=490 1x\"><img alt=\"A Ferrari 812 spotted on Park Lane\" data-original-image-height=\"1\" data-original-image-width=\"900\" data-image-type=\"image\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/e1ff1844-6780-4531-a627-46a0a9a90ad1\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fe1ff1844-6780-4531-a627-46a0a9a90ad1.png?fit=scale-down&amp;source=next&amp;width=700\"></picture>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\tA Ferrari 812 spotted on Park Lane © Dougie Wallace\n\t\t\t</figcaption>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t<p>Shmee took supercar spotting, a relatively unknown hobby, and turned it into a profitable enterprise. Everyone&nbsp;I meet knows him; everyone aspires to a similar future. Unlike train spotters who simply enjoy the meditative activity of watching railway lines, most supercar spotters are in it for the money. For online marketer Andrew, 45, who has been spotting for almost four years, the goal is to become “rich and famous”. Each weekend he comes to Knightsbridge to film content for&nbsp;his fledgling channel, “even when [his] fingers are too&nbsp;cold to press the record button”. Once a channel hits&nbsp;1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watched content within 12 months, the owner can apply for the YouTube Partner Programme. Those accepted make around $4.20 per 1,000 views; Shmee’s channel has more than 1bn. But most of all, Andrew just really likes cars. He&nbsp;watches a Lamborghini Huracán STO pass by with the&nbsp;wistful eyes of a lover.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s hard to surmise the relationship between spotters and supercars. But a huge part of it is to do with freedom: cars have long been symbols of personal mobility. Add that to a six- or seven-figure price tag and Batmobile-style scissor doors and the results are irresistible. “Cars are a very emotional thing,” says Shmee extravagantly. “The sound, the feeling – the idea of what they can achieve, what they’re capable of – captivates the imagination.”&nbsp;</p><div data-layout-width=\"full-grid\"><figure><picture><source data-original-image-height=\"1600\" data-original-image-width=\"1600\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/8b1b8307-107a-4005-ace7-ae23ede166da\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F8b1b8307-107a-4005-ace7-ae23ede166da.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=490\" media=\"screen and (max-width: 490px)\"><source data-original-image-height=\"1600\" data-original-image-width=\"2400\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/9bdcbf8c-e98e-49c3-9be1-3c2069d533ed\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F9bdcbf8c-e98e-49c3-9be1-3c2069d533ed.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=1260\" media=\"screen and (min-width: 980px)\"><img srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F9143f156-3a85-4aa7-929c-fdbfbeac50c8.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=700 1x, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F9143f156-3a85-4aa7-929c-fdbfbeac50c8.jpg?dpr=2&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=medium&amp;source=next&amp;width=700 2x\" alt=\"A Ferrari F8 rolls by the Rolex store in Knightsbridge\" data-original-image-height=\"1600\" data-original-image-width=\"2400\" data-image-type=\"image\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/9143f156-3a85-4aa7-929c-fdbfbeac50c8\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F9143f156-3a85-4aa7-929c-fdbfbeac50c8.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=700\"></picture><figcaption data-has-caption=\"true\">A Ferrari F8 rolls by the Rolex store in Knightsbridge © Dougie Wallace</figcaption></figure></div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t<p>Not everyone will agree – least of all the long-term residents of Park Lane. There is a long, documented struggle between supercar owners and west-Londoners, many of whom have set up campaign groups against noisy&nbsp;revvers and boy racers. “People are not sleeping until three or four in the morning,” Karen, a Knightsbridge&nbsp;local, told AFP News Agency in the early&nbsp;stages of the spotting craze. “There’s a lot of testosterone&nbsp;going up and down&nbsp;Sloane Street,” added her daughter, Alexandra, who wore periwinkle eyeshadow and a pearl necklace. “This is probably one of the few times in my life where&nbsp;I’m&nbsp;glad to be deaf.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p><span>\n\t\t\t\t\t$4.20\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\tThe approximate payout to YouTube Partner Programme members per 1,000 video views\n\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>If not testosterone, then there’s certainly braggadocio. Often I try counting the number of supercars with parking tickets: I quickly lose count. One culprit, an orange Lamborghini Aventador, has the word “WE04&nbsp;PON” for a number plate. Another has a sticker inviting fans to follow him on Instagram. Outside Harrods, I question Abdulaziz, who drives a crimson Ferrari, on what it is about the supercar that sets his pulse racing. “Why do you get up in the morning and go to&nbsp;work?” he responds. By Abdulaziz’s expression, it’s apparent he only does so for the love of his vehicle.</p><p>Dedicated spotters have better relationships with owners, who have been known to offer&nbsp;rides and stage personal photo shoots. Shmee, who has been on both sides of this arrangement, advises “being polite, friendly” and, above all,&nbsp;respecting an owner’s privacy. “There’s a temptation to go exploring where you shouldn’t.” Cars are kept in a handful of private garages scattered across the city, most famously Windrush’s secret “bat cave” in west London. And good&nbsp;luck getting&nbsp;any intel on that.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t<picture><source media=\"(min-width: 1220px)\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fcac5b4f9-3994-4903-8d55-c1005bdcdd44.png?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;source=next&amp;width=700 1x\"> <source media=\"(min-width: 980px) and (max-width: 1219px)\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fcac5b4f9-3994-4903-8d55-c1005bdcdd44.png?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;source=next&amp;width=540 1x\"> <source media=\"(min-width:491px) and (max-width: 979px)\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fcac5b4f9-3994-4903-8d55-c1005bdcdd44.png?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;source=next&amp;width=700 1x\"> <source media=\"(max-width: 490px)\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fcac5b4f9-3994-4903-8d55-c1005bdcdd44.png?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;source=next&amp;width=490 1x\"><img alt=\"Snapping a Ferrari FF\" data-original-image-height=\"1\" data-original-image-width=\"900\" data-image-type=\"image\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/cac5b4f9-3994-4903-8d55-c1005bdcdd44\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fcac5b4f9-3994-4903-8d55-c1005bdcdd44.png?fit=scale-down&amp;source=next&amp;width=700\"></picture>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\tSnapping a Ferrari FF © Dougie Wallace\n\t\t\t</figcaption>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t<p>Photographer Josh Scoot, 21, has become such a hit with supercar owners that he’s toured the garages of not only Shmee, but American car show host Jay Leno and entrepreneur Richard Rawlings of <a data-trackable=\"link\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.gasmonkeygarage.com/\">Gas Monkey Garage</a>. Scoot is what you might call a collector: his early days were spent travelling London with a pen and paper, keeping a note of supercars and their various editions. His first major spot was a Zonda Cinque, one of just 10 models made including the Cinque Roadsters. Today, he’s seen four. “Fingers crossed I can see all 10,” he says, an unlikely feat given that most are “kept underground, collecting dust, as they’re so rare.”&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t<p>When Scoot started spotting as a teenager, he found the hobby difficult to explain. “I didn’t have any confidence to tell even my closest mates,” says Scoot, who drives a Ford Fiesta; his “poster car” is a Ferrari 458. The experience led him to launch a series exploring bullying, discrimination and mental health on car enthusiast platform <a data-trackable=\"link\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.petrolheadonism.club/\">Petrolheadonism</a>. Despite its closed ranks, those that do break into the super-spotter clique find the camaraderie to be the nicest thing about supercar&nbsp;spotting. “You see the same people every week,” says Tom, 16, of the hundreds of WhatsApp groups born out of spotting. Shmee also brings spotters together with regular car events; unsurprisingly, he&nbsp;calls&nbsp;them “Shmeetings”.&nbsp;</p><div data-layout-width=\"full-grid\"><figure><picture><source data-original-image-height=\"1600\" data-original-image-width=\"1600\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/cee9f6a6-a3de-4b26-abfe-b601effbe17b\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fcee9f6a6-a3de-4b26-abfe-b601effbe17b.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=490\" media=\"screen and (max-width: 490px)\"><source data-original-image-height=\"1600\" data-original-image-width=\"2400\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/1c2987a6-9184-4540-875d-2f5174ac5363\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F1c2987a6-9184-4540-875d-2f5174ac5363.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=1260\" media=\"screen and (min-width: 980px)\"><img srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F7f15210d-18a7-4697-9216-481bd1bcd301.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=700 1x, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F7f15210d-18a7-4697-9216-481bd1bcd301.jpg?dpr=2&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=medium&amp;source=next&amp;width=700 2x\" alt=\"A Porsche Cayman GT4 in Knightsbridge\" data-original-image-height=\"1600\" data-original-image-width=\"2400\" data-image-type=\"image\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/7f15210d-18a7-4697-9216-481bd1bcd301\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F7f15210d-18a7-4697-9216-481bd1bcd301.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=700\"></picture><figcaption data-has-caption=\"true\">A Porsche Cayman GT4 in Knightsbridge © Dougie Wallace</figcaption></figure></div><div data-layout-width=\"full-grid\"><figure><picture><source data-original-image-height=\"1800\" data-original-image-width=\"1800\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/43b186da-a9c0-4973-8e9e-8703945b5fa6\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F43b186da-a9c0-4973-8e9e-8703945b5fa6.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=490\" media=\"screen and (max-width: 490px)\"><source data-original-image-height=\"1800\" data-original-image-width=\"2400\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/44de6ecf-5caa-4899-bceb-db97b6659d75\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F44de6ecf-5caa-4899-bceb-db97b6659d75.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=1260\" media=\"screen and (min-width: 980px)\"><img srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F0b21b7b0-97f7-4446-b53f-1db55f1a3ce4.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=700 1x, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F0b21b7b0-97f7-4446-b53f-1db55f1a3ce4.jpg?dpr=2&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=medium&amp;source=next&amp;width=700 2x\" alt=\"A Ferrari 488 Spider driver\" data-original-image-height=\"1800\" data-original-image-width=\"2400\" data-image-type=\"image\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/0b21b7b0-97f7-4446-b53f-1db55f1a3ce4\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F0b21b7b0-97f7-4446-b53f-1db55f1a3ce4.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=700\"></picture><figcaption data-has-caption=\"true\">A Ferrari 488 Spider driver © Dougie Wallace</figcaption></figure></div><p>As the community has grown, so have the supercars.&nbsp;With UK ownership expanding by around 20 per cent in recent years, brands have stepped up their technology in pursuit of better track times. “Factory-manufactured Ferraris no longer turn heads,” says Botho Stein, general manager of <a data-trackable=\"link\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.themayfairhotel.co.uk/\">The May Fair Hotel</a>, who has seen traction in “bespoke and custom-made cars such as&nbsp;Aston Martin One-77, Porsche 918 Spyder and Bugatti Chiron” outside his hotel. At Lamborghini, where global sales are up 10 per cent, the recent Sián FKP 37 (£2.6mn), has a carbon-fibre body, V12 engine and weighs just 1,645kg. All units sold out before their unveiling. Wilder still are limited-edition models by Ferrari, McLaren and Aston Martin made without roofs or windscreens.</p><p>What do these changes mean for the supercar owner?&nbsp;The experience of driving these cars, one can assume, should be luxurious. “This is probably the thing&nbsp;that makes no sense,” giggles Shmee, “but the feeling of a supercar is generally one of being less comfortable. It’s noisier, vibrating; the seats aren’t so lovely and plush.” And yet. To drive one is to achieve a state that transcends all rhyme, reason and sensible spending. “You either get it or you don’t.”</p><div data-layout-width=\"full-grid\"><figure><picture><source data-original-image-height=\"1800\" data-original-image-width=\"1800\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/62147944-f0d3-43fc-b8f9-4a8849f6fca4\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F62147944-f0d3-43fc-b8f9-4a8849f6fca4.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=490\" media=\"screen and (max-width: 490px)\"><source data-original-image-height=\"1800\" data-original-image-width=\"2400\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/489ab833-70d6-4b1b-a17c-15b932744265\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F489ab833-70d6-4b1b-a17c-15b932744265.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=1260\" media=\"screen and (min-width: 980px)\"><img srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F5e7a6e85-e32e-4b3d-a004-07563b9b4aa8.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=700 1x, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F5e7a6e85-e32e-4b3d-a004-07563b9b4aa8.jpg?dpr=2&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=medium&amp;source=next&amp;width=700 2x\" alt=\"An unusual classic spotted in Knightsbridge\" data-original-image-height=\"1800\" data-original-image-width=\"2400\" data-image-type=\"image\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/5e7a6e85-e32e-4b3d-a004-07563b9b4aa8\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F5e7a6e85-e32e-4b3d-a004-07563b9b4aa8.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=700\"></picture><figcaption data-has-caption=\"true\">An unusual classic spotted in Knightsbridge  © Dougie Wallace</figcaption></figure></div><div data-layout-width=\"full-grid\"><figure><picture><source data-original-image-height=\"1600\" data-original-image-width=\"1600\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/454c261e-cfd1-4aec-a80b-987617ac8726\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F454c261e-cfd1-4aec-a80b-987617ac8726.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=490\" media=\"screen and (max-width: 490px)\"><source data-original-image-height=\"1600\" data-original-image-width=\"2400\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/52afac7b-d141-4acb-aaa9-5281e18ab00f\" srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F52afac7b-d141-4acb-aaa9-5281e18ab00f.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=1260\" media=\"screen and (min-width: 980px)\"><img srcset=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F5ba42bcb-c0f4-4759-9417-86e97d0685b0.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=700 1x, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F5ba42bcb-c0f4-4759-9417-86e97d0685b0.jpg?dpr=2&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=medium&amp;source=next&amp;width=700 2x\" alt=\"A spotter admires a Lamborghini Huracán STO\" data-original-image-height=\"1600\" data-original-image-width=\"2400\" data-image-type=\"image\" data-id=\"https://api.ft.com/content/5ba42bcb-c0f4-4759-9417-86e97d0685b0\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F5ba42bcb-c0f4-4759-9417-86e97d0685b0.jpg?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=700\"></picture><figcaption data-has-caption=\"true\">A spotter admires a Lamborghini Huracán STO © Dougie Wallace</figcaption></figure></div><p>While I still don’t quite “get it”, I certainly feel closer. To catch a supercar is to touch a world of limitless potential, where success stories abound and raw ambition is rewarded. Behind every supercar is someone who “made it”; every rev is a roar of triumph.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<p>I return to Knightsbridge for a final time in February, when the supercar’s roar is more of an occasional bark. The past few months have been quieter than usual – “they’ve gone to Monaco”, says Andrew mournfully. And it’s true that the super-web is spreading. <a data-trackable=\"link\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.hrowen.co.uk/\">HR Owen</a>’s £30mn Hatfield headquarters has created a new content-heavy hotspot. But the “rolling motor show of central London”, as Shmee calls it, will forever be the spotter’s heartland. Where else is a McLaren Senna as commonplace as a bright-red postbox?&nbsp;</p></div></div>"
